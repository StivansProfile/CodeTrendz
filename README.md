<h1>What is it ?</h1>
<p>This is a project dedicated to helping people understand what is in demand in today's software development job market and save them time with the power of automation.</p>
<p>The way this app tries to do it is by scrapping job postings and extracting the most relevant topics out of them. This creates a list of key topics and words
that are included in the job postings data. The topics are then presented nicely by using graphs. This allows the users to look at information that they may find useful when
studying the job market.</p>
